// üîß Scenario: The Shopkeeper‚Äôs Calculator Woes

// üìù Story-Based Prompt:
// Raj is a humble shopkeeper who recently got a custom-built calculator from a local coder. He uses it daily to perform basic arithmetic operations and calculate total prices with tax. But his customers have started complaining about strange results:

// üìú One day, a customer tried to divide a bill of ‚Çπ100 by 0 (due to an input mistake), and the calculator returned Infinity!
// üìú On another occasion, Raj forgot to add tax to the bill, and the total charged was less than expected. His regulars noticed the discrepancy.
// To calculate total with tax:
// totalWithTax = price + (price √ó taxRate)
// Assume taxRate = 0.18 (i.e., 18%)

// üìú Raj recently started using the calculator to generate invoices. One day, while entering product prices, he accidentally entered a negative number (e.g., -‚Çπ150). The calculator happily accepted it, and the total came out as a negative amount ‚Äî which confused both Raj and the customer.
// ‚ÄúWhy do I owe them money when they‚Äôre buying from me?!‚Äù he exclaimed.
// Now, Raj realizes his calculator needs proper validation too.

// üìå Raj needs your help to fix these bugs and make the calculator reliable again.
