// # // 🔧 Scenario: The Shopkeeper’s Calculator Woes

// # // 📝 Story-Based Prompt:
// # // Raj is a humble shopkeeper who recently got a custom-built calculator from a local coder. He uses it daily to perform basic arithmetic operations and calculate total prices with tax. But his customers have started complaining about strange results:

// # // 📜 One day, a customer tried to divide a bill of ₹100 by 0 (due to an input mistake), and the calculator returned Infinity!
// # // 📜 On another occasion, Raj forgot to add tax to the bill, and the total charged was less than expected. His regulars noticed the discrepancy.
// # // To calculate total with tax:
// # // totalWithTax = price + (price × taxRate)
// # // Assume taxRate = 0.18 (i.e., 18%)

// # // 📜 Raj recently started using the calculator to generate invoices. One day, while entering product prices, he accidentally entered a negative number (e.g., -₹150). The calculator happily accepted it, and the total came out as a negative amount — which confused both Raj and the customer.
// # // “Why do I owe them money when they’re buying from me?!” he exclaimed.
// # // Now, Raj realizes his calculator needs proper validation too.

// # // 📌 Raj needs your help to fix these bugs and make the calculator reliable again.
