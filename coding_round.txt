1. The Gatekeeper’s Secret Number
At the entrance of a mystical fortress, a gatekeeper challenges you with a number puzzle.

He says:
“If the number you choose can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself, the gate will open. Otherwise, it stays locked.”

Write a program to check whether the number meets this condition.

2. The Ancient Sequence Scroll
You discover an old scroll with a strange number pattern:
Each number in the pattern is the sum of the two numbers that come before it, starting with 0 and 1.

The scroll contains a secret:

If the position you choose in the sequence is odd, show the sequence from that position backwards to the start.

If the position is even, show the sequence forwards from the start to that position.

Write a program that, given a position number, prints the sequence according to these rules.

3. The Enchanted Treasure Chest
You find a treasure chest with a numeric lock. To open it, you need to:

Add together all the digits of the number written on the chest.

Then multiply all whole numbers from 1 up to that sum to get a special code.

Enter that code to unlock the chest.

Write a function that takes the number on the chest and returns this special code
